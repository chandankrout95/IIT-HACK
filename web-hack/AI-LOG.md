## 🧠 THE INTELLIGENCE CORE

Cosmic Watch is not merely a data aggregator; it is a **Synthetic Intelligence Layer** designed to bridge the gap between raw NASA telemetry and planetary defense readiness. The system utilizes three core AI-driven pillars:

### 1. Neural Risk Weighting (NRW)
The engine discards static data in favor of **Dynamic Heuristics**. It calculates the "Danger Index" by executing a real-time correlation between:
* **Kinetic Impact Potential:** Cross-analyzing relative velocity against estimated diameter.
* **Gravitational Near-Miss:** Calculating the trajectory decay relative to Earth's lunar distance ($LD$).
* **Hazardous Synthesis:** Mapping NASA’s binary classification into a 100-point non-linear risk scale.



### 2. Spatial Awareness & Telemetry
The UI utilizes **Autonomous 3D Projections** powered by Three.js (R3F). 
* **Drift Simulation:** Orbital bodies are not static; they use dampening algorithms to simulate actual space-time drift.
* **Reactive Feedback:** The 3D environment is context-aware, responding to user "hover" inputs to simulate a neural-link interface between the user and the planetary data.



### 3. The Data Nexus (Vault)
The system employs **Intelligence Persistence** through a Redux-governed memory state. 
* **Pattern Retention:** High-threat targets are "cached" within the encrypted Vault, allowing the AI to prioritize telemetry of previously identified objects.
* **Noise Filtering:** The AI strips metadata "noise" from the NeoWs API, focusing exclusively on targets that disrupt planetary safety thresholds.
