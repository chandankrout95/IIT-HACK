## 🛠️ AI ASSISTANCE DECLARATION

In accordance with competition guidelines, this document details the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the development of **Cosmic Watch**. AI was utilized as a technical consultant and boilerplate accelerator, not as a replacement for original engineering and architectural decision-making.

### 1. 📂 Roles & Responsibilities
| Phase | Human Effort (Original) | AI Assistance (LLM) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Architecture** | System design, State Management structure, Redux Slice logic. | Suggestions for efficient folder structures. |
| **Logic** | Custom Risk Engine formulas, NASA API data mapping. | Debugging complex filter functions. |
| **3D Engine** | Three.js scene setup, coordinate mapping. | Mathematical boilerplate for orbital rotation. |
| **Styling** | Tactical UI theme, custom Tailwind configurations. | Generation of utility-class combinations. |
| **Real-time** | Socket.io event orchestration, Cloudinary integration. | Troubleshooting connection heartbeat logic. |

## 🧠 SPECIFIC AI USE CASES

### A. Mathematical Refinement
The **Neural Risk Engine** calculates a threat score using non-linear variables. LLMs were used to refine the mathematical syntax of the trajectory projections within the `AsteroidGraphModal.jsx`, ensuring the Recharts visualization correctly rendered the decay of distance over time.






### B. Component Boilerplate
To maintain a rapid development pace, AI was used to generate initial functional skeletons for repetitive UI elements (e.g., `QuickStat` components). This allowed the human developers to focus on the complex **NASA NeoWs** data parsing and **Socket.io** event handling.

### C. Debugging & Error Handling
AI was leveraged to interpret obscure error logs from the **Three.js** renderer and to provide optimized `try/catch` blocks for the NASA API uplink to ensure system stability during network fluctuations.

## ⚖️ ETHICAL COMPLIANCE
* **No Code Copying:** All logic regarding the "Vault" (Redux persistence) and the tactical storytelling landing page was manually orchestrated by the team.
* **Originality:** The "Planetary Threat Index" scoring algorithm is a custom-weighted logic designed specifically for this project.
* **Manual Integration:** Every AI-suggested code snippet was reviewed, refactored to fit the project’s specific CSS variables, and manually integrated to ensure code quality and security.

## 📝 CONCLUSION
The use of AI in this project was restricted to **augmented development**. All core features, including the real-time synchronization, custom tactical aesthetics, and asset management via Cloudinary, represent the original work and creative problem-solving of the human development team.
