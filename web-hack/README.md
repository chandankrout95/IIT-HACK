## ⚡ CORE CAPABILITIES

### 🔭 Neural Radar Uplink (Socket.io)
Powered by **Socket.io** for low-latency data streaming. The system maintains a persistent bi-directional handshake with the server to push real-time NASA NeoWs updates to the terminal every 60 seconds without manual refreshes.

### 🧠 Tactical Risk Engine
Our proprietary engine executes a non-linear analysis of:
* **Velocity vs. Mass:** Kinetic energy potential and impact magnitude.
* **Proximity:** Gravitational encounter probability ($LD$ scales).
* **Danger Index:** A synthesized 0-100% threat score per target.

### ☁️ Optimized Asset Delivery (Cloudinary)
All high-resolution tactical textures, GIFs, and galactic imagery are served via **Cloudinary’s Global CDN**, ensuring sub-second load times for critical visual intelligence.

### 🗄️ The Vault (Persistence)
Archive high-priority threats to your local encrypted database. Powered by **Redux Toolkit**, your intelligence persists across sessions, ensuring no target is lost in the noise.
